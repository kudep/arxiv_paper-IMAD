To produce clean data, it is important to have dialogues created with humans. They could be collected either from crowd-sourcing or written by humans, such as in English books. Therefore, we have chosen the dataset sources listed below to make our data valid and diverse in terms of dialogue content: DailyDialog, Persona Chat, MuTual, DREAM, Common-sense dialogues, and Empathetic Dialogues \cite{Zhang-2018,Li-Su-2017,cui-etal-2020-mutual,Zhou-2021,Rashkin-2018,Sun-2019}. Detailed reasons are provided in Appendix B.

With these sources, we have collected 451,611 pairs of utterances with context and images. This dataset contains all the features and model predictions described below.

The filtered version of the dataset is named IMage-Augmented Multi-modal Dialogue Dataset (IMAD) and is used later for modeling. It is constructed with a combination of the Text-Image Replacing approach and Human Annotated part. Basic statistics are shown in Table \ref{TableBasicStatistics}.
